  <p>	There has been a rapid surge in the development of artificial intelligence, especially in the last few years. AI software, particularly text-based generative AI such as ChatGPT has become progressively normalized in daily routines. ChatGPT was introduced in 2018 and stands as a prominent example with its growing popularity in recent years (IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 2023). It has reshaped various aspects, influencing scientific research, transforming the delivery of information in education, analyzing media and news, improving health and medical care, and even generating literature and art (Ninth International Conference on Social Analysis, Management and Security, 2023). As we navigate this evolving information technology, it is essential to consider the potential positives and concerns that come with the normalization of AI, as well as its history. Looking ahead: How will these norms continue to evolve and reshape our future? </p>
  <p><strong>Here is a comparison of some popular text-based generative AI software:</strong></p>

   <p>Expedition 33 is such a fun adventure game. I really liked exploring the different areas and figuring out the puzzles. The game keeps you thinking, but it's never frustrating since they also allow you to change difficuly. I especially enjoyed the way the story unfolds as you play and it makes you want to keep going to see what happens next.</p>

    <p>The graphics and soundtrack are amazing too. They really make the world feel alive, and I found myself paying attention to even small details. Some puzzles were tricky, but solving them felt really satisfying especially with the music. I also liked how the game gives you choices sometimes, which can change what happens in the story.</p>

    <p>Overall, Expedition 33 is a cool game if you like exploring, solving puzzles, and just having a relaxing adventure. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys story-driven games with some challenges along the way.</p>
