  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="hannah.png" alt="List of Industrial Engineering AI Tools & AI Software, categorized by function " style="width:300px;height:350px;">

<p>Hi, I'm Hannah! My interest in technology comes from how it shapes the way we connect, work, and navigate the world, and I'm passionate about making it more intuitive, ethical, and accessible. I'm currently studying information science with a minor in bioethics, because I want to explore how technology and ethical considerations intersect. I'm especially interested in ensuring digital systems are designed to be both functional and responsible, balancing innovation with fairness and transparency. Whether it's exploring AI-powered tools, optimizing user experiences, or working with data-driven solutions, I'm always looking for ways to make technology more effective and ethical.</p>
  
<p>Beyond tech, I love playing video games, baking new recipes, and traveling around the world. Whether I'm immersed in an open-world RPG, perfecting a cookie recipe, or exploring a new city, I enjoy creativity and problem-solving in all aspects of life. I'm always excited to learn something new, experiment with different ideas, and find innovative ways to make technology work better for people.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the countries I've traveled to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
