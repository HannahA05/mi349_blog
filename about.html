  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="ME.png" alt="List of Industrial Engineering AI Tools & AI Software, categorized by function " style="width:300px;height:400px;">

<p>Hi, I'm Hannah! My interest in technology comes from how it shapes the way we connect, work, and navigate the world. I'm passionate about making health technology more intuitive, ethical, and accessible. I'm currently studying information science with a minor in bioethics because I want to explore the intersection of technology, data, and ethical considerations in healthcare. I'm particularly interested in health informatics, data-driven solutions, and patient-centered technologies that help improve medical outcomes and make healthcare more equitable.</p>
  
<p>Beyond tech, I love playing video games, baking new recipes, and traveling around the world. Whether I'm immersed in an open-world RPG, perfecting a cookie recipe, or exploring a new city, I enjoy creativity and problem-solving in all aspects of life. I'm always excited to learn something new, experiment with different ideas, and find innovative ways to make technology work better for people.</p>

<p><strong>Some of the countries I've traveled to include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Syria</li>
